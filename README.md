# FISR
Specialized FPU for Fast Inverse Square Root Algorithm

----
Got inspired from this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8u_k2LIZyo)!  
I might think it would be easy to understand what we did if you watch the above video. 

FISR algorithm computes the inverse square root( $y = {{1}\over {\sqrt x}}$ ) 4 times faster than traditional methods with IEEE floating point tricks.  

We have succeeded in implementing this algorithm as digital circuits using Verilog. Hope you enjoy viewing our work!
