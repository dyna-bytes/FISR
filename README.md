# FISR
Specialized FPU for Fast Inverse Square Root Algorithm

----
Got inspired from this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8u_k2LIZyo).  
I might think it would be easy to understand what we did if you watch this video! 

FISR algorithm computes the inverse square root( $1\over\sqrt(y)$ ) 4 times faster than traditional methods with an IEEE floating point tricks.  

We have succeeded in implementing this algorithm as digital circuits using Verilog. Hope you enjoy viewing our work!
